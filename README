Bottlecap is a tiny static HTTP server.

To install (using pip+virtualenvwrapper, because it's the simplest, and that's the idea here):

## Make a virtualenv to serve as a toggle for bottlecap usage
$ mkvirtualenv bottlecap
## Install bottlecap
$ pip install https://github.com/sshirokov/bottlecap/tarball/master
