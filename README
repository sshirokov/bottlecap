Bottlecap is a tiny static HTTP server.
I built it on Bottle <http://bottle.paws.de/docs/dev/index.html>


Requirements:
        bottle

Required to follow this file directly:
         virtualenvwrapper
         pip

###############
### INSTALL ###
###############

## Make a virtualenv to serve as a toggle for bottlecap usage
$ mkvirtualenv bottlecap

## Install bottlecap
$ pip install https://github.com/sshirokov/bottlecap/tarball/master

##############
#### USE #####
##############

## Activate the bottlecap virtualenv
$ workon bottlecap

## Go to where you want to serve data
$ cd ~/src/my-project

## Run bottlecap
$ bottlecap

## Go to http://localhost:6969
$ open http://localhost:6969 # OS X example

##############
### NOTES ####
##############
## Like, tips and tricks?

=> 'bottlecap -h' Will display command-line help

=> Instead of changing to a directory you can tell bottlecap to server from
   elsewhere with the -m PATH/--media=PATH options.


That's pretty much it.
The code isn't awesome because I hacked together pretty quick.
If there's any ever interest, I'll clean it up.

Have Fun!
